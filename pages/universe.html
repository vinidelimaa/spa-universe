  <h1>The Universe</h1>

  <p>
    The word "Universo" comes from the Latin "universum." The Latin term was
    used by Cicero and later by other authors with the same meaning it currently
    holds. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction "unvorsum" —
    first used by Lucretius in Book IV of his "On the Nature of Things" — which
    combines "un" or "uni" (one) with "vorsum" or "versum" (meaning "something
    turned, rolled, or changed").
