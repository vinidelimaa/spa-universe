    Celestial bodies and celestial events have always been a subject of great
    fascination for humanity. There are records of Greeks, Mesopotamians, and
    Aztecs describing various celestial occurrences. In the contemporary era,
    several scientists have made major contributions to turn the dream of
    exploring space into a reality, such as the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,
    the German Hermann Oberth, and the American Robert Goddard.
